<h1>The Best Movies According Sam</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
<p>Wonderful story about a less-than-average guy, 
    who was successful in everything he did,
just because he obeyed good advices.</p>
<h3>Matrix</h3>
<p>Although it contains many philosophical elements I don't like or agree with,
    it was groundbreaking movie about search for truth.
</p>
<h3>Passion of the Christ</h3>
<p>Very realistic portret of my best friend and about what he has done for me.</p>
